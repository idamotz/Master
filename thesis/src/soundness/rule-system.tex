\section{Soundness of the Rule System}
In Section~\vref{sec:soundness-of-each-rule}, we have shown that each of the analysis rules operates within the scope of its associated operation. We have also shown that all of the rules preserve well-formedness for the interval-based feature model, and that they update the model correctly according to the semantics of their associated operations. We summarise this into three theorems that together show that the rule system is sound.

In Section~\vref{sec:soundness-of-each-rule} we have shown that each of the analysis rules operates within the scope of an operation. \footnote{See lemmas \ref{lemma:add-feature-scope}, \ref{lemma:add-group-scope}, \ref{lemma:remove-feature-scope}, \ref{lemma:remove-group-scope}, \ref{lemma:move-feature-scope}, \ref{lemma:move-group-scope}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-variation-type-scope}, \ref{lemma:change-group-variation-type-scope}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-name-scope}}
\\
\begin{theorem}
  The rule system supports local modification and verification of interval-based feature models.
\end{theorem}

Section~\vref{sec:soundness-of-each-rule} shows that each of the analysis rules preserves well-formedness of the interval-based feature model.\footnote{See lemmas \ref{lemma:add-feature-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:add-group-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:remove-feature-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:remove-group-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:move-feature-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:move-group-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-variation-type-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:change-group-variation-type-well-formed}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-name-well-formed}}
\\
\begin{theorem}
  The rule system for local modification of interval-based feature models is well-formed.
\end{theorem}

Section~\vref{sec:soundness-of-each-rule} shows that each of the analysis rules behaves according to the semantics of the operation in question.\footnote{See lemmas \ref{lemma:add-feature-mod}, \ref{lemma:add-group-mod}, \ref{lemma:remove-feature-mod}, \ref{lemma:remove-group-mod}, \ref{lemma:move-feature-mod}, \ref{lemma:move-group-mod}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-variation-type-mod}, \ref{lemma:change-group-variation-type-mod}, \ref{lemma:change-feature-name-mod}}
\\
\begin{theorem}
  The rule system for local modification of interval-based feature models modifies the model correctly.
\end{theorem}
