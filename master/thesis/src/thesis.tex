\part{Definitions, Analysis, and Soundness Proofs}

Help the reader distinguish the plan and the change of plan (maybe in background). Make an illustration that can help convey the terminology (when I say this word, I'm in this level, etc.)
Forskerlinjen is part of the story and research work. Can include what we did earlier, since the thesis is based on this work. Focus on the operations. Not necessary to have the rules here, but can refer to the paper. Can use it to explain what it means to be paradox-free. Can say what the plan looks like and what a sound plan is, and refer the reader to the paper for more details. Then say in this project I will look at modular modifications of a plan (the previous work does not tackle plan change). Since it is already published, the sensor does not need to evaluate that part, only the continuation which is this thesis. However, the previous work is a necessary part of the story of this thesis.
