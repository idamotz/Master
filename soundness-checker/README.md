# Soundness checker

This project provides methods for validating the result of applying an operation to a temporal feature model. It also makes it possible to convert from a simple feature model evolution plan to a temporal feature model.

## Build
```sh
stack build
```

## Run
```sh
stack run
```
This outputs an example temporal feature model.
